#### Why doesn't MobileOrg support direct access to org-files

Answer: MobileOrg is intended to be a useful interface to Org files on iOS, not to allow you to edit Org files with the same power as emacs.

#### Why doesn't MobileOrg support synchronisation over github

Answer: The current asynchronous method of push/pull with org-mobile.el could lead to a number of conflicts with git. However git synchronisation is a feature planned to be worked on in the future.

#### Whenever I switch to MobileOrg a new note is created

Answer: This occurs if 'Autocapture' is switched on, some find this desirable for rapidly capturing ideas.
