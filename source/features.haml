%h1 MobileOrg feature overview
%p

    - Complete editing support, including editable headings, body text, todo state, tags and priority.

    - Mark nodes as done, or flag them with an optional note for reference later

%h1 Org-mode integration
%p
  :markdown
    Org-mode has built-in support for MobileOrg (or any other mobile client that may come along in the future and use the same asymmetric synchronization approach).

    - A simple org-mobile-push will stage your complete set of Org-files for MobileOrg to pick them up. The result includes:
      - An Org file representing all of your custom agenda views
      - Automatic checksum file construction to speed up sync
      - Automatic index.org file generation with links to all of your Org files

    - A powerful org-mobile-pull command, which will integrate changes youâ€™ve made on the go into a local Org file
