      <description>Getting Started MobileOrg uses a WebDAV server or Dropbox to interact with your Org files. It downloads Org files from the server and uploads captured notes to a mobileorg.org file on the same server. The documentation below covers how to get started using Dropbox or set up a WebDAV account (using free services or your own server), how to download and finally browse Org files stored on your device.</description>

      <description>Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t MobileOrg support direct access to org-files Answer: MobileOrg is intended to be a useful interface to Org files on iOS, not to allow you to edit Org files with the same power as emacs.
Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t MobileOrg support synchronisation over github Answer: The current asynchronous method of push/pull with org-mobile.el could lead to a number of conflicts with git. However git synchronisation is a feature planned to be worked on in the future.</description>
